        <p>
            Giraffes are the tallest mammals on Earth. Their legs alone are taller than many humans.
            A giraffe's neck is too short to reach the ground. As a result, it has to awkwardly spread its front legs or 
            kneel to reach the ground for a drink of water. They spend most of their lives standing up; they even 
            sleep and give birth standing up.
